# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

## Spring 2018 Assignments

Trabajos propuestos de forma p√∫blica dentro del curso de la Universidad de Stanford.

* Assignment #1: Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Neural Network

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

    * understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
    * understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
    * develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
    * implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
    * implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
    * implement and apply a Softmax classifier
    * implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
    * understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
    * get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
